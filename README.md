Migrate Bitbucket issues to Github
==================================

Migrate Bitbucket issues to Github, with comments.


Installation
------------

1. Create a virtualenv and activate it.
1. Clone this repo.
1. `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. `$ python bb2gh_issues.py -h`

You'll see an explanation of options.


Example
-------

```
$ python bb2gh_issues.py -l viniciusban -p my_password -r test_repo bb-issues.json
```


Notes and known limitations
---------------------------

You must [export your issues in Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Export+or+Import+Issue+Data), first.

Issues import cannot be undone. So, I suggest you to run this process in a test repository before importing them to your real one.

Images in our issues will not be migrated. If you can help me with this, I'll accept your pull request.

All issues created on Github will have your `--login` user as the creator and the commenter. So, each issue and comment will have a note to tell you who and when created the issue (or comment).

You can preserve issues' assignees. Edit `bb2gh_issues.py` and change the `ASSIGNEES` dict to represent your situation. Read comments on source code.

Depending on how many issues and comments you have, this process can take a while. Don't panic.


Options explained
-----------------

1. `-l`, `--login`

    You need to be logged in to create issues in Github. This is the
    username will be the creator of all issues and comments in this process.

1. `-p`, `--password`

    Password for `--login` user.

1. `-r`, `--repo`

    The repository will receive your issues.

    The username who owns the repo. Also known as the username that appears
    in the repo url. I.e.: http://github.com/**this_is_the_username**/reponame

    If ommited, `--login` will be used.

1. `--no-assignees`

    Don't use assignee information.
